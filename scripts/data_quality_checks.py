"""
scripts/data_quality_checks.py
================================
Automated version of tests/data_quality_test.sql. Runs the same checks,
but each one returns pass/fail instead of just a number to eyeball —
so this can be wired into a pipeline and stop it on failure.

Tests 1-7 and 10 have a clear expected value (usually 0, or an exact
equality) and are treated as hard pass/fail checks.
Tests 8 and 9 don't have a single correct answer (they're for a human
to sanity-check business logic and date range), so they're only logged,
never fail the run.

Exit code: 0 if all hard checks pass, 1 if any fail.

Run manually:
    uv run scripts/data_quality_checks.py
